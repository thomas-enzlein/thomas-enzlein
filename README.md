### Hi there 👋

I'm Thomas Enzlein, deputy group leader in bioinformatics at CeMOS - Center for Mass Spectrometry and Optical Spectroscopy based in Mannheim and Bochum, Germany. I've honed my expertise in data science with a keen focus on advancing research in Alzheimer's disease through Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI). 

🔍 My top skills include R, Shiny, data visualization, and statistics, matched with a strong background in Biomedical Science and Technology, which I studied at Hochschule Mannheim. My academic journey culminated with a PhD in Biomedical Sciences from KU Leuven, where I deepened my knowledge and research capabilities.

🌐 Besides being fluent in German and English, I'm proficient in R, I can comfortably work with Python and possess foundational knowledge in C++, primarily for integrating C++ code into R using Rcpp.

Let's connect and discover how we can collaborate on up-and-coming bioinformatics endeavors or dive into the vast ocean of data science together!
